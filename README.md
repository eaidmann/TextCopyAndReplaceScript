# TextCopyAndReplaceScript

Basically, this is just a simple script to backup your file into different folder, and replace a test inside it.

In this script, we will back up the Original_Text.txt file first into the backup folder as Original_Text_bkp.txt.
Then, we will replace the value "30" inside the Original_Text.txt file to "25".

How it work ?
1. The script will first check whether the backup file already existed inside the backup folder or not. If not, the script will backup the file first.
2. Then, it will check if the value "30" exist inside the file or not.
3. If existed, then it will replace its value to "25".

Simple project as my hobby :)
